“Cold Reading”: How to Convince 
Strangers that You Know 
All About Them 


Ray Hyman 


Over twenty years ago I taught a course at Harvard University called 
‘Applications of Social Psychology.”’ The sort of applications that I cov- 
ered were the various ways in which people were manipulated. I invited 
various manipulators to demonstrate their techniques—pitchmen, 
encyclopedia salesmen, hypnotists, advertising experts, evangelists, 
confidence men, and a variety of individuals who dealt with personal prob-. 
lems. The techniques which we discussed, especially those concerned with 
helping people with their personal problems, seem to involve the client’s 
tendency to find more meaning in any situation than is actually there. 
Students readily accepted this explanation when it was pointed out to 
them. But I did not feel that they fully realized just how pervasive and 
powerful this human tendency to make sense out of nonsense really is. 

Consequently, in 1955 I wrote a paper entitled ‘““The Psychological 
Reading: An Infallible Technique For Winning Admiration and 
Popularity.”” Over the years I have distributed copies of this paper to my 
students. The paper begins as follows: 


So you want to be admired? You want people to seek your company, to talk 
about you, to praise your talents? This manuscript tells you how to satisfy 
that want. Herein you will find a “‘sure-fire’”’ gimmick for the achievement of 
fame and popularity. Just follow the advice that I give you, and, even if you 
are the most incompetent social bungler, you cannot fail to become the life 
of the party. What is the secret that underlies this infallible system? The 
secret, my friend, is a simple and obvious one. It has been tried and proven 
by practitioners since the beginnings of mankind. Here is the gist of the 
secret: To be popular with your fellow man, tell him what he wants to hear. 
He wants to hear about himself. So tell him about himself. But not what you 
know to be true about him. Oh, no! Never tell him the truth. Rather, tell him 
what he would like to be true about himself!’ And there you have it. Simple

and obvious, but yet so powerful. This manuscript details the way in which 
you can exploit this golden rule by assuming the role of a character reader. 


I will include essentially the same recipe for character reading in this 
paper that I give to my students. In addition | will bring the material up to 
date, describe some relevant research, and indicate some theoretical rea- 
sons why the technique ‘‘works.’’ My purpose is not to enable you to en- 
hance your personal magnetism, nor is it to increase the number of char- 
acter readers. I give you these rules for reading character because I want 
you to experience how the method works. I want you to see what a power- 
_ ful technique the psychological reading is, how convincing it is to the psy- 
chologist and layman alike. 

When you see how easy it is to convince a person that you can read his 
character on sight, you will better appreciate why fortune tellers and psy- 
chologists are frequently lulled into placing credence in techniques which 
have not been validated by acceptable scientific methods. The recent con- 
troversy in The Humanist magazine and THE ZETETIC over the scientific 
status of astrology probably is irrelevant to the reasons that individuals be- 
lieve in astrology. Almost without exception the defenders of astrology 
with whom I have contact do not refer to the evidence relating to the un- 
derlying theory. They are convinced of astrology’s value because it 
“works.” By this they mean that it supplies them with feedback that ‘‘feels 
right’”—that convinces them that the horoscope provides a basis for 
understanding themselves and ordering their lives. It has personal 
meaning for them. . 

Some philosophers distinguish between ‘‘persuasion’’ and ‘“‘convic- 
tion.’’ The distinction is subtle. But for our purposes we can think of 
subjective experiences that persuade us that something is so and of logical 
and scientific procedures that convince, or ought to convince, us that 
something is or is not so. Quite frequently a scientist commits time and 
resources toward generating scientific evidence for a proposition because 
he has already been persuaded, on nonscientific grounds, that the proposi- 
tion is true. Such intuitive persuasion plays an important motivational role 
in science as well as in the arts. Pathological science and false beliefs come 
about when such intuitive persuasion overrides or colors the evidence from 
objective procedures for establishing conviction. 

The field of personality assessment has always been plagued by this 
confusion between persuasion and conviction. In contrast to intelligence 
and aptitude tests, the scientific validation of personality tests, even under 


Spring/Summer 1977 19 


ideal conditions, rarely results in unequivocal or satisfactory results. In 
fact some of the most widely used personality inventories have repeatedly 
failed to pass validity checks. One of the reasons for this messy state of af- 
fairs is the lack of reliable and objective criteria against which to check the 
results of an assessment. 

But the lack of adequate validation has not prevented the use of, and 
reliance on, such instruments. Assessment psychologists have always 
placed more reliance on their instruments than is warranted by the scienti- 
fic evidence. Both psychologist and client are invariably persuaded by the 
results that the assessment “‘works.”’ 

This state of affairs, of course, is even more true when we consider 
divination systems beyond those of the academic and professional psy- 
chologist. Every system—be it based on the position of the stars, the pat- 
tern of lines in the hand, the shape of the face or skull, the fall of the cards 
or the dice, the accidents of nature, or the intuitions of a ‘“‘psychic’’— 
claims its quota of satisfied customers. The client invariably feels satisfied 
_ with the results. He is convinced that the reader and the system have pene- 
trated to the core of his “true” self. Such satisfaction on the part of the 
client also feeds back upon the reader. Even if the reader began his career 
with little belief in his method, the inevitable reinforcement of persuaded 
clients increases his confidence in himself and his system. In this way a 
“vicious circle” is established. The reader and his clients become more 
and more persuaded that they have hold of a direct pipeline to the ‘‘truth.”’ 

The state of affairs in which the evaluation of an assessment instru- 
ment depends upon the satisfaction of the client is known as ‘‘personal 
validation.” Personal validation is, for all practical purposes, the major 
reason for the persistence of divinatory and assessment procedures. If the 
client is not persuaded, then the system will not survive. Personal valida- 
tion, of course, is the basis for the acceptance of more than just assessment 
instruments. The widespread acceptance of myths about Bigfoot, the 
Bermuda Triangle, ancient astronauts, ghosts, the validity of meditation 
and consciousness-raising schemes, and a host of other beliefs is based on 
persuasion through personal validation rather than scientific conviction. 


Cold reading 
“Cold reading” is a procedure by which a “reader’’ is able to persuade a 


client whom he has never before met that he knows all about the client’s 
personality and problems. At one extreme this can be accomplished 


20 . THE ZETETIC 


by delivering a stock spiel, or “psychological reading,”’ that consists of 
highly general statements that can fit any individual. A reader who relies 
on psychological readings will usually have memorized a set of stock 
spiels. He then can select a reading to deliver that is relatively more appro- 
priate to the general category that the client fits—a young unmarried girl, 
a senior citizen, and so on. Such an attempt to fit the reading to the client 
makes the psychological reading a closer approximation to the true cold 
reading. 

The cold reading, at its best, provides the client with a character as- 
sessment that is uniquely tailored to fit him or her. The reader begins with 
the same assumptions that guide the psychological reader who relies on 
the stock spiel. These assumptions are (1) that we all are basically more 
alike than different; (2) that our problems are generated by the same 
major transitions of birth, puberty, work, marriage, children, old age, and 
death; (3) that, with the exception of curiosity seekers and troublemakers, 
people come to a character reader because they need someone to listen to 
their conflicts involving love, money, and health. The cold reader goes be- 
yond these common denominators by gathering as much additional infor- 
mation about the client as possible. Sometimes such information is 
obtained in advance of the reading. If the reading is through appointment, 
the reader can use directories and other sources to gather information. 
When the client enters the consulting room, an assistant can examine the 
coat left behind (and often the purse as well) for papers, notes, labels, and 
other such cues about socioeconomic status, and so on. Most cold readers, 
however, do not need such advance information. 

The cold reader basically relies on a good memory and acute observa- 
tion. The client is carefully studied. The clothing—for example, style, 
neatness, cost, age—provides a host of cues for helping the reader make 
shrewd guesses about socioeconomic level, conservatism or extroversion, 
and other characteristics. The client’s physical features—weight, posture, 
looks, eyes, and hands provide further cues. The hands are especially re- 
vealing to the good reader. The manner of speech, use of grammar, ges- 
tures, and eye contact are also good sources. To the good reader the huge 
amount of information coming from an initial sizing-up of the client 
greatly narrows the possible categories into which he classifies clients. His 
knowledge of actuarial and statistical data about various subcultures in the 
population already provides him the basis for making an uncanny and 
strikingly accurate assessment of the client. 

But the skilled reader can go much further in particularizing his 


Spring/Summer 1977 21 


reading. He wants to zero in as quickly as possible on the precise problem 
that is bothering the client. On the basis of his initial assessment he makes 
some tentative hypotheses. He tests these out by beginning his assessment 
in general terms, touching upon general categories of problems and 
watching the reaction of the client. If he is on the wrong track the client’s 
reactions—eye movements, pupillary dilation, other bodily mannerisms— 
will warn him. When he is on the right track other reactions will tell him 
so. By watching the client’s reactions as he tests out different hypotheses 
during his spiel, the good reader quickly hits upon what is bothering the 
customer and begins to adjust the reading to the situation. By this time, 
the client has usually been persuaded that the reader, by some uncanny 
means, has gained insights into the client's innermost thoughts. His 
guard is now down. Often he opens up and actually tells the reader, who is 
also a good listener, the details of his situation. The reader, after a suitable 
interval, will usually feed back the information that the client has given 
him in such a way that the client will be further amazed at how much the 
reader “‘knows”’ about him. Invariably the client leaves the reader without 
realizing that everything he has been told is simply what he himself has 
unwittingly revealed to the reader. 


The stock spiel 


The preceding paragraphs indicate that the cold reader is a highly skilled 
and talented individual. And this is true. But what is amazing about this 
area of human assessment is how successfully even an unskilled and in- 
competent reader can persuade a client that he has fathomed the client’s 
true nature. It is probably a tribute to the creativeness of the human mind 
that a client can, under the right circumstances, make sense out of almost 
any reading and manage to fit it to his own unique situation. All that is 
necessary is that the reader make out a plausible case for why the reading 
ought to fit. The client will do the rest. 

You can achieve a surprisingly high degree of success as a character 
reader even if you merely use a stock spiel which you give to every client. 
Sundberg (1955), for example, found that if you deliver the following char- 
acter sketch to a college male, ne will usually accept it as a reasonably ac- 
curate description of himself: ““You are a person who is very normal in his 
attitudes, behavior and relationships with people. You get along well 
without effort. People naturally like you and you are not overly critical of 
them or yourself. You are neither overly conventional nor overly individu- 


22 THE ZETETIC 


alistic. Your prevailing mood is one of optimism and constructive effort, 
and you are not troubled by periods of depression, psychosomatic illness 
or nervous symptoms.”’ 

Sundberg found that the college female wil] respond with even more 
pleasure to the following sketch: ““You appear to be a cheerful, well- 
balanced person. You may have some alternation of happy and unhappy 
moods, but they are not extreme now. You have few or no problems with 
your health. You are sociable and mix well with others. You are adaptable 
to social situations. You tend to be adventurous. Your interests are wide. 
You are fairly self-confident and usually think clearly.” 

Sundberg conducted his study over 20 years ago. But the sketches still 
work well today. Either will tend to work well with both sexes. More re- 
cently, several laboratory studies have had excellent success with the 
following stock spiel (Snyder and Shenkel 1975): 


Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic. At times you are ex- 
troverted, affable, sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary 
and reserved. You have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself 
to others. You pride yourself on being an independent thinker and do not 
accept others’ opinions without satisfactory proof. You prefer a certain 
amount of change and variety, and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by 
restrictions and limitations. At times you have serious doubts as to whether 
you have made the right decision or done the right thing. Disciplined and 
controlled on the outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure on the 
inside. 

Your sexual adjustment has presented some problems for you. While 
you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate 
for them. You have a great deal of unused capacity which you have not 
turned to your advantage. You have a tendency to be critical of yourself. 
You have a strong need for other people to like you and for them to admire 
you. 


Interestingly enough the statements in this stock spiel were first used 
in 1948 by Bertram Forer (1949) in a classroom demonstration of personal 
validation. He obtained most of them from a newsstand astrology book. 
Forer’s students, who thought the sketch was uniquely intended for them 
as a result of a personality test, gave the sketch an average rating of 4.26 
on a scale of 0 (poor) to S (perfect). As many as 16 out of his 39 students (41 
percent) rated it as a perfect fit to their personality. Only five gave it a 
rating below 4 (the worst being a rating of 2, meaning “average’’). 
Almost 30 years later students give the same sketch an almost identical 
rating as a unique description of themselves.

The technique in action 


The acceptability of the stock spiel depends upon the method and circum- 
stances of its delivery. As we shall later see, laboratory studies have 
isolated many of the factors that contribute to persuading clients that the 
sketch is a unique description of themselves. A great deal of the success of 
the spiel depends upon “setting the stage.’’ The reader tries to persuade 
the client that the sketch is tailored especially for him or her. The reader 
also creates the impression that it is based on a reliable and proven 


Fortune Cookies 
Philip J. Klass 


Those who enjoy Chinese food cannot resist reading the con- 
tents of the fortune cookie delivered with the check, and I'm no 
exception. For many years I put no more stock in the predictions 
of fortune cookies than | put in astrological charts. But circum- 
stances have now forced me to revise this earlier erroneous ap- 
praisal. 

My conversion started during the time that I was writing my 
first book while simultaneously holding down a full-time position; 
I had begun to despair that I had undertaken too much. Then my 
spirits were buoyed by a fortune cookie that said: ‘“‘Cheer up, the 
end is in sight.” Soon the manuscript was completed and a tre- 
mendous load had been lifted. 

A few months later my fortune cookie predicted: ‘You will 
soon be invited to a party.’ Because I abhor parties like Nature 
abhors a vacuum, I probably receive no more than two such invi- 
tations a year. Certainly this fortune cookie forecast would turn 
out to be a “bummer.” 

Yet that very evening as I walked into my apartment, the — 
telephone was ringing. When I answered I found that the caller 
was a woman I had met only briefly more than a year earlier. She 
was calling to invite me to a party! 

A few months later, while lunching in my favorite Chinese 
restaurant, | found myself seated next to an attractive Chinese

assessment procedure. The way the sketch is delivered and dramatized 
also helps. And many of the rules that I give for the cold reading also apply 
to the delivery of the stock spiel. 

The stock spiel, when properly delivered, can be quite effective. In 
fact, with the right combination of circumstances the stock spiel is often 
accepted as a perfect and unique description by the client. But, in general, 
one can achieve even greater success as a character analyst if one uses the 
more flexible technique of the cold reader. In this method one plays a sort 
of detective role in which one takes on the role of a Sherlock Holmes. (See 





woman, also eating alone. When she chanced to compliment me 
on my use of chopsticks, a conversation ensued. It matured 
rapidly when I learned she was a divorcee. 

When our fortune cookies arrived I opened mine first. It 
read: ‘“‘A rewarding friendship will soon develop.” Hers read: 
‘““Look forward to many pleasures ahead.’’ My prediction proved 
quite accurate. It would be indelicate for me to comment on the 
accuracy of hers. 

More recently, less than ten days before I was scheduled to 
depart for a ski vacation in Colorado, I opened my fortune cookie 
to find the following message: ‘““You will have a trip, but see that 
you keep on your feet.”” That is precisely what a skier tries to do. 

I must admit that I once received a fortune cookie predic- 
tion stating that ‘Your mate will have a surprise for you tonight.” 
My initial reaction was that I might meet and marry my “dream 
girl” before the day was out. When that did not materialize, it did 
not shake my faith in fortune cookies. Instead, I attribute this to 
a simple human error on the part of my waiter—who goofed in his 
selection process. 

Eventually the scientific community will awaken to the re- 
markable prescience of Chinese fortune cookies and will launch 
an investigation into the underlying principles. When this occurs 
it may be found that this remarkable property is the result of a 
heretofore unknown reaction between the subatomic particles of 
the flour used in the cookies and the ink used to print the mes- 
sage. But I admit this is a speculative hypothesis.

the ‘Case of the Cardboard Box”’ for an excellent example of cold reading.) 
One observes the jewelry, prices the clothing, evaluates the speech 
mannerisms, and studies the reactions of the subject. Then whatever in- 
formation these observations provide is pieced together into a character 
reading which is aimed more specifically at the particular client. 

A good illustration of the cold reader in action occurs in a story told 
by the well-known magician John Mulholland. The incident took place in 
the 1930s. A young lady in her late twenties or early thirties visited a 
character reader. She was wearing expensive jewelry, a wedding band, and 
a black dress of cheap material. The observant reader noted that she was 
wearing shoes which were currently being advertised for people with foot 
trouble. (Pause at this point and imagine that you are the reader; see what 
you would make of these clues.) 

By means of just these observations the reader proceeded to amaze 
his client with his insights. He assumed that this client came to see him, as 
did most of his female customers, because of a love or financial problem. 
The black dress and the wedding band led him to reason that her husband 
had died recently. The expensive jewelry suggested that she had been fi- 
nancially comfortable during marriage, but the cheap dress indicated that 
her husband’s death had left her penniless. The therapeutic shoes signi- 
fied that she was now standing on her feet more than she was used to, 
implying that she was working to support herself since her husband’s 
death. 

The reader’s shrewdness led him to the following conclusion—which 
’ turned out to be correct: The lady had met a man who had proposed to 
her. She wanted to marry the man to end her economic hardship. But she 
felt guilty about marrying so soon after her husband’s death. The reader 
told her what she had come to hear—that it was all right to marry without 
further delay. 


The rules of the game 


Whether you prefer to use the formula reading or to employ the more flex- 
ible technique of the cold reader, the following bits of advice will help to 
contribute to your success as a character reader. 

1. Rernember that the key ingredient of a successful character 
reading is confidence. \f you look and act as if you believe in what you are 
doing, you will be able to sell even a bad reading to most of your subjects. 

The laboratory studies support this rule. Many readings are accepted 


26 THE ZETETIC 


as accurate because the statements do fit most people. But even readings 
that would ordinarily be rejected as inaccurate will be accepted if the 
reader is viewed as a person with prestige or as someone who knows what 
he is doing. 

One danger of playing the role of reader is that you will persuade 
yourself that you really are divining true character. This happened to me. I 
Started reading palms when I was in my teens as a way to supplement my 
income from doing magic and mental shows. When I started I did not 
believe in palmistry. But I knew that to “‘sell’’ it I had to act as if I did. 
After a few years I became a firm believer in palmistry. One day the late 
Dr. Stanley Jaks, who was a professional mentalist and a man I respected, 
tactfully suggested that it would make an interesting experiment if I 
deliberately gave readings opposite to what the lines indicated. [ tried this 
out with a few clients. To my surprise and horror my readings were just as 
successful as ever. Ever since then I have been interested in the powerful 
forces that convince us, reader and client alike, that something is so when 
it really isn’t. 

2. Make creative use of the latest statistical abstracts, polls, and 
surveys. This can provide you with a wealth of material about what various 
subclasses of our society believe, do, want, worry about, and so on. For ex- 
ample if you can ascertain about a client such things as the part of the | 
country he comes from, the size of the city he was brought up in, his 
parents’ religion and vocations, his educational level and age, you already 
are in possession of information that should enable you to predict with 
high probability his voting preferences, his beliefs on many issues, and 
other traits. 

3. Set the stage for your reading. Profess a modesty about your 
talents. Make no excessive claims. This catches your subject off guard. 
You are not challenging him to a battle of wits. You can read his character; 
whether he cares to believe you or not is his concern. 

4. Gain his cooperation in advance. Emphasize that the success of 
the reading depends as much upon his sincere cooperation as upon your 
efforts. (After all, you imply, you already have a successful career at read- 
ing characters. You are not on trial—he is.) State that due to difficulties of 
language and communication, you may not always convey the exact mean- 
ing which you intend. In these cases he is to strive to reinterpret the mes- 
sage in terms of his own vocabulary and life. 

You accomplish two invaluable ends with this dodge. You have an 
alibi in case the reading doesn’t click; it’s his fault, not yours! And your 


Spring/Summer 1977 27 


subject will strive to fit- your generalities to his specific life occurrences. 
Later, when he recalls the reading he will recall it in terms of specifics; 
thus you gain credit for much more than you actually said. 

Of all the pieces of advice this is the most crucial. To the extent that 
the client 1s made an active participant in the reading the reading will suc- 
ceed. The good reader, deliberately or unwittingly, is the one who forces 
the client to actively search his memory to make sense of the reader’s 
statements. 

5. Use a gimmick such as a crystal ball, tarot cards, or palm reading. 
The use of palmistry, say, serves two useful purposes. It lends an air of 
novelty to the reading; but, more important, it serves as a cover for you to 
stall and to formulate your next statement. While you are trying to think 
of something to say next, you are apparently carefully studying a new 
wrinkle or line in the hand. Holding hands, in addition to any emotional 
thrills you may give or receive thereby, is another good way of detecting the 
reactions of the subject to what you are saying (the principle is the same as 
‘“*muscle reading’’). 

It helps, in the case of palmistry or other gimmicks, to study some 
manuals so that you know roughly what the various diagnostic signs are 
supposed to mean. A clever way of using such gimmicks to pin down a 
client’s problem is to use a variant of ““Twenty Questions,’’ somewhat like 
this: Tell the client you have only a limited amount of time for the reading. 
You could focus on the heart line, which deals with emotional 
entanglements; on the fate line, which deals with vocational pursuits and 
money matters; the head line, which deals with personal problems; the 
health line, and so on. Ask him or her which one to focus on first. This 
quickly pins down the major category of problem on the client’s mind. 

6. Have a list of stock phrases at the tip of your tongue. Even if you are 
doing a cold reading, the liberal sprinkling of stock phrases amidst your 
regular reading will add body to the reading and will fill in time as you try 
to formulate more precise characterizations. You can use the statements 
in the preceding stock spiels as a start. Memorize a few of them before un- 
dertaking your initial ventures into character reading. Palmisty, tarot, and 
other fortune-telling manuals also are rich sources for good phrases. 

7. Keep your eyes open. Also use your other senses. We have seen how 
to size up the client on the basis of clothing, jewelry, mannerisms, and 
speech. Even a crude classification on such a basis can provide sufficient 
information for a good reading. Watch the impact of your statements 
upon the subject. Very quickly you will learn when you are “hitting home”’ 


28 THE ZETETIC 


and when you are ‘“‘missing the boat.” 

8. Use the technique of “fishing.” This is simply a device for getting 
the subject to tell you about himself. Then you rephrase what he has told 
you into a coherent sketch and feed it back to him. One version of fishing 
is to phrase each statement in the form of a question. Then wait for the 
subject to reply (or react). If the reaction is positive, then the reader turns 
the statement into a positive assertion. Often the subject will respond by 
answering the implied question and then some. Later he will tend to forget 
that he was the source of your information. By making your statements 
into questions you also force the subject to search through his memory to 
retrieve specific instances to fit your general statement. 

9. Learn to be a good listener. During the course of a reading your 
client will be bursting to talk about incidents that are brought up. The 
good reader allows the client to talk at will. On one occasion I observed a 
tea-leaf reader. The client actually spent 75 percent of the total time 
talking. Afterward when I questioned the client about the reading she 
vehemently insisted that she had not uttered a single word during the 
course of the reading. The client praised the reader for having so astutely 
told her what in fact she herself had spoken. 

Another value of listening is that most clients who seek the services of 
a reader actually want someone to listen to their problems. In addition 
many clients have already made up their minds about what choices they 
are going to make. They merely want support to carry out their decision. 

10. Dramatize your reading. Give back what little information you 
do have or pick up a little bit at a time. Make it seem more than it is. Build 
word pictures around each divulgence. Don’t be afraid of hamming it up. 

11. Always give the impression that you know more than you are 
saying. The successful reader, like the family doctor, always acts as if he 
knows much more. Once you persuade the client that you know one item 
of information about him that you could not possibly have obtained 
through normal channels, the client will automatically assume you know 
all. At this point he will typically open up and confide in you. 

12. Don't be afraid to flatter your subject every chance you get. An 
occasional subject will protest such flattery, but will still cherish it. In such 
cases you can further flatter him by saying, ‘“‘You are always suspicious of 
people who flatter you. You just can’t believe that someone will say good of 
you unless he is trying to achieve some ulterior goal.”’ 

13. Finally, remember the golden rule: Tell the client what he wants 
to hear. 


Spring/Summer 1977 29 


Sigmund Freud once made an astute observation. He had a client 
who had been to a fortune-teller many years previously. The fortune-teller 
had predicted that she would have twins. Actually she never had children. 
Yet, despite the fact that the reader had been wrong, the client still spoke 
of her in glowing terms. Freud tried to figure out why this was so. He fi- 
nally concluded that at the time of the original reading the client wanted 
desperately to have children. The fortune-teller sensed this and told her 
what she wanted to hear. From this Freud inferred that the successful for- 
tune-teller is one who predicts what the client secretly wishes to happen 
rather than what actually will happen (Freud 1933). 


The fallacy of personal validation 


As we have seen, clients will readily accept stock spiels such as those I 
have presented as unique descriptions of themselves. Many laboratory ex- 
periments have demonstrated this effect. Forer (1949) called the tendency 
to accept as valid a personality sketch on the basis of the client’s willing- 
ness to accept it “‘the fallacy of personal validation.” 

The early studies on personal validation were simply demonstrations 
to show that students, personnel directors, and others can readily be 
persuaded to accept a fake sketch as a valid description of themselves. A 
few studies tried to go beyond the demonstration and tease out factors 
that influence the acceptability of the fake sketch. Sundberg (1955), for 
example, gave the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (known as 
the MMPI) to 44 students. The MMPI is the most carefully standardized 
personality inventory in the psychologist’s tool kit. Two psychologists, 
highly experienced in interpreting the outcome of the MMPI, wrote a 
personality sketch for each student on the basis of his or her test results. 
Each student then received two personality sketches—the one actually 
written for him or her and a fake sketch. When asked to pick which sketch 
described him or her better, 26 of the 44 students (59 percent) picked the 
fake sketch! 

Sundberg’s study highlights one of the difficulties in this area. A fake, 
universal sketch can be seen as a better description of oneself than can 
a uniquely tailored description by trained psychologists based upon one of 
the best assessment devices we have. This makes personal validation a 
completely useless procedure. But it makes the life of the character reader 
and the pseudopsychologist all the easier. His general and universal state- 
ments have more persuasive appeal than do the best and most appropriate 


30 THE ZETETIC 


descriptions that the trained psychologist can come up with. 

Some experiments that my students and I conducted during the 1950s 
also supplied some more information about the acceptability of such 
sketches. In one experiment we gave some students a fake sketch (the third 
stock spiel previously discussed) and told half of them that it was the result 
of an astrological reading and the other half that it was the result of a new 
test, the Harvard Basic Personality Profile. In those days, unlike today, 
students had a low opinion of astrology. All the students rated each of the 
individual statements as generally true of themselves. The groups did not 
differ in their ratings of the acceptability of the individual statements. But 
when asked to rate the sketch as a whole, the group that thought it came 
from an accepted personality test rated the acceptability significantly 
higher than did the group that thought it came from an astrologer. From 
talking to individual students it was clear that those who were in the 
personality-test group believed that they had received a highly accurate 
and unique characterization of themselves. Those in the astrology group 
admitted that the individual statements were applicable to themselves but 
dismissed the apparent success of the astrologer as due to the fact that the 
statements were so general that they would fit anyone. In other words, by 
changing the context in which they got the statements we were able to 
manipulate the subjects’ perceptions as to whether the statements were 
generalities that applied to everyone or were specific characterizations of 
themselves. 

In a further experiment we obtained a pool of items that 80 percent or 
more of Harvard students endorsed as true of themselves. We then had 
another group of Harvard students rate these items as “desirable” or ‘‘un- 
desirable’ and as ‘‘general”’ or “particular” (true of only a few students). 
Thus we had a set of items that we knew almost all our subjects would en- 
dorse as true of themselves, but which varied on desirability and on per- 
ceived generality. We were then able to compose fake sketches which 
varied in their proportion of desirable and specific items. We found that 
the best recipe for creating acceptable stock spiels was to include about 75 
percent desirable items, but ones which were seen as specific, and about 25 
percent undesirable items, but ones which were seen as general. The un- 
desirable items had the apparent effect of making the spiel plausible. The 
fact that the items were seen as being generally true of other students 
made them more acceptable. 

The most extensive program of research to study the factors making 
for acceptability of fake sketches is that by C. R. Snyder and his associates 


Spring/Summer 1977 31 


at the University of Kansas. A brief summary of many of his findings was 
given in an article in Psychology Today (Snyder and Shenkel 1975). In 
most of his studies Snyder uses a control condition in which the subject is 
given the fake sketch and told that this sketch is generally true for all 
people. On a rating scale from 1 to 5 (1, very poor; 2, poor; 3, average; 4, 
good; 5, excellent) the subject rates how well the interpretation fits his 
personality. A typical result for this control condition is a rating of around 
3 to 4, or between average and good. But when the sketch is presented to 
the subject as one which was written “‘for you, personally,’’ the accept- 
ability tends to go up to around 4.5, or between good and excellent. 

In a related experiment the subjects were given the fake sketch under 
the pretense that it was based on an astrological reading. The control 
group, given the sketch as “‘generally true for all people,” rated it about 
3.2, or just about average. A second group was asked to supply the as- 
trologer with information on the year and month of their birth. When they 
received their sketches they rated them on the average at 3.76, or just 
below good. A third group supplied the mythical astrologer with infor- 
mation on year, month, and day of birth. These subjects gave a mean 
rating of 4.38. | 

From experiments such as those we have learned the following. The 
acceptability of a general sketch is enhanced when (1) the reader or source 
is believed to know what he is doing, (2) the instrument or assessment de- 
vice is plausible, (3) a lot of mumbo jumbo is associated with the proce- 
dure (such as giving month, day, hour, and minute of birth along with a lot 
of complicated calculations), and (4) the client is led to believe that 
the sketch has been tailored to his personality. When these conditions are 
met, the client, and possibly the reader as well, have a strong “‘illusion of 
uniqueness’’—that is, the client is persuaded that the sketch describes 
himself or herself and no one else. 


Why does it work? 


But why does it work? And why does it work so well? It does not help 
to say that people are gullible or suggestible. Nor can we dismiss it by 
implying that some individuals are just not sufficiently discriminating or 
lack sufficient intelligence to see through it. Indeed one can argue that it 
requires a certain degree of intelligence on the part of a client for the 
reading to work well. Once the client is actively engaged in trying to make 
sense of the series of sometimes contradictory statements issuing from the 


32 THE ZETETIC 


reader, he becomes a creative problem-solver trying to find coherence and 
meaning in the total set of statements. The task is not unlike that of trying 
to make sense of a work of art, a poem, or, for that matter, a sentence. The 
work of art, the poem, or the sentence serve as a blueprint or plan from 
which we can construct a meaningful experience by bringing to bear our 
own past experiences and memories. 

In other words the reading succeeds just because it calls upon the 
normal processes of comprehension that we ordinarily bring to bear in 
making sense out of any form of communication. The raw information in a 
communication is rarely, if ever, sufficient in itself for comprehension. A 
shared context and background is assumed. Much has to be filled in by 
inference. The good reader, like anyone who manipulates our perceptions, 
is merely exploiting the normal processes by which we make sense out of 
the disorderly array of inputs that constantly bombard us. 

A variety of examples and experiments could be drawn upon to il- 
lustrate this point. Let us look at a couple of instructive cases. Dr. Joseph 
Weizenbaum, of M.I.T., developed a computer program that would 
enable a human to apparently carry on a conversation with a computer. 
One version of his program is called ‘“‘Doctor.”” The program is designed 
to “talk” like a Rogerian psychotherapist. Such a therapist is relatively 
easy to imitate because the basis of Rogers’ technique is simply to feed 
the patient’s statements back to him in a paraphrased form. The human, 
playing the role of the patient, types in questions and answers on a 
teletype machine. The computer, under control of the program, types 
replies and questions on the same teletype paper. A typical example (Wel- 
zenbaum 1976) of a conversation between a young lady and Doctor 
follows. (The lady speaks first. The computer’s responses are printed in 
italics.) 


Men are all alike. 

In what way? 

They’re always bugging us about something or other. 
Can you think of a specific example? 

Well, my boyfriend made me come here. 

Your boyfriend made you come here? 

He says I'm depressed much of the time. 

I am sorry to hear you are depressed. 

It's true. | am unhappy. 

Do you think coming here will help you not to be unhappy? 
I need some help, that much seems certain. 

What would it mean to you if you got some help?

Perhaps I could learn to get along with my mother. 
Tell me more about your family. 
My mother takes care of me. 
Who else in your family takes care of you? 
. My father. 
Your father? 
You are like my father in some ways. 
What resemblance do you see? 
You are not very aggressive, but I think you don’t want me to notice that. 
What makes you think I am not very aggressive? 
You don’t argue with me. 
Why do you think I don't argue with you? 
You are afraid of me. 
Does it please you to believe I am afraid of you? 
My father is afraid of everybody. 
What else comes to mind when you think of your father? 
Bullies. | 
Does that have anything to do with the fact that your boyfriend made you 
come here? 


Doctor is a quite primitive program as natural-language programs go. 
It employs a lot of'tricks and stock phrases. It has no mechanisms for ac- 
tually understanding sentences. Instead it seeks out key words that are 
typed and does some simple syntactical transformations. For example, if 
the program sees a sentence of the form “‘Do you X”’ it automatically 
prints out the response ““‘What makes you think I X?’’ When Doctor 
cannot match the syntax of a given sentence it can cover up in two ways. It 
can say something noncommittal, such as ‘‘Please go on” or ‘““What does 
that suggest to you?”’ Or it can recall an earlier match and refer back to it, 
as for example, ‘‘How does this relate to your depression?"’ where depres- 
sion was an earlier topic of conversation. 

In essence Doctor is a primitive cold reader. It uses stock phrases to 
cover up when it cannot deal with a given question or input. And it uses 
the patient’s own input to feed back information and create the illusion 
that it understands and even sympathizes with the patient. This illusion is 
so powerful that patients, even when told they are dealing with a relatively 
simple-minded program, become emotionally involved in the interaction. 
Many refuse to believe that they are dealing with a program and insist that 
a sympathetic human must be at the controls at the other end of the 
teletype. 

Sociologist Harold Garfinkel has supplied another instructive exam- 
ple (1967). He conducted the following experiment. The subjects were told 


34 THE ZETETIC 


that the Department of Psychiatry was exploring alternative means to 
therapy “as a way of giving persons advice about their personal 
problems.” Each subject was then asked to discuss the background of 
some serious problem on which he would like advice. After having done 
this the subject was to address some questions which could be answered 
‘yes’ or “‘no”’ to the “‘counselor’’ (actually an experimenter). The experi- 
menter-counselor heard the questions from an adjoining room and 
supplied a ‘‘yes” or “‘no’’ answer to each question after a suitable pause. 
Unknown to the subject, the series of yes-no answers had been prepro- 
grammed according to a table of random numbers and was not related 
to his questions. Yet the typical subject was sure that the counselor fully 
understood the subject’s problem and was giving him sound and helpful 
advice. 

Let me emphasize again that statements as such have no meaning. 
They convey meaning only in context and only when the listener or reader 
can bring to bear his large store of worldly knowledge. Clients are not 
necessarily acting irrationally when they find meaning in the stock spiels 
or cold readings. Meaning is an interaction of expectations, context, 
memory, and given statements. An experiment by the Gestalt psychologist 
Solomon Asch (1948) will help make this point. Subjects were given the 
following passage and asked to think about it: “I hold it that a little rebel- 
lion, now and then, is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world 
as storms are in the physical.”’” One group of subjects was told that the 
author of the passage was Thomas Jefferson (which happens to be true). 
The subjects were asked if they agreed with the passage and what it meant 
to them. These subjects generally approved of it and interpreted the word 
rebellion to mean minor agitation. But when subjects were given the same 
passage and told that its author was Lenin, they disagreed with it and in- 
terpreted rebellion to mean a violent revolution. 

According to some social psychologists the different reactions show 
the irrationality of prejudice. But Asch points out that the subjects could 
be acting quite rationally. Given what they know about Thomas Jefferson 
and Lenin, or what they believe about them, it makes sense to attribute 
different meanings to the same words spoken by each of them. If one 
thinks that Jefferson believed in orderly government and peaceful 
processes, then it would not make sense to interpret his statement to 
actually mean a bloody or physical revolution. If one thinks that Lenin 
favors war and bloodshed, then it makes sense, when the statement is at- 
tributed to him, to interpret rebellion in its more extreme form.

Some recent research that my colleagues and I conducted might also 
be relevant here. Our subjects were given the task of forming an 
impression of a hypothetical individual on the basis of a brief personality 
sketch. In one condition the subjects were given a sketch that generally 
led to an impression of a nice, personable, friendly sort of fellow. In a 
second condition the subjects were given a sketch that created an 
impression of a withdrawn, niggardly individual. Both groups of subjects 
were then given a new sketch that supposedly contained more information 
about the hypothetical individual. In both cases the subjects were given an 
identical sketch. This sketch contained some descriptors that were 
consistent with the friendly image and some that were consistent with the 
niggardly image. The subjects were later tested to see how well they 
recognized the actual adjectives that were used in the second sketch. One 
of the adjectives, for example, was charitable. The test contained foils for 
each adjective. For example, the word generous also appeared on the test 
but did not appear in the sketch. Yet subjects who had been given the 
friendly impression checked generous just as frequently as they checked 
charitable. But subjects in the other condition did not confuse charitable 
with generous. Why? Because, we theorize, the two different contexts into 
which charitable had to be integrated produced quite different meanings. 
When subjects who have already built up an impression of a ‘‘friendly”’ 
individual encounter the additional descriptor charitable, it is treated as 
merely further confirmation of their general impression. In that context 
charitable is simply further confirmation of the nice-guy image. Conse- 
quently when these subjects are asked to remember what was actually 
said, they can remember only that the individual was further described in 
some way to enhance the good-guy image, and generous is just as good a 
candidate for the description as is charitable in that context. 

But when the subjects who have an image of the person as a with- 
drawn, niggardly individual encounter charitable, the last thing that 
comes to mind is generosity. Instead, they probably interpret charitable as 
implying that he donates money to charities as a way of gaining tax 
deductions. In this latter condition the subjects have no subsequent 
tendency to confuse charitable with generous. 

The cold reading works so well, then, because it taps a fundamental 
and necessary human process. We have to bring our knowledge and 
expectations to bear in order to comprehend anything in our world. In 
most ordinary situations this use of context and memory enables us to 
correctly interpret statements and supply the necessary inferences to do 


36 THE ZETETIC 


this. But this powerful mechanism can go astray in situations where there 
is no actual message being conveyed. Instead of picking up random noise 
we still manage to find meaning in the situation. So the same system that 
enables us to creatively find meanings and make new discoveries also 
makes us extremely vulnerable to exploitation by all sorts of manipulators. 
In the case of the cold reading the manipulator may be conscious of his 
deception; but often he, too, is a victim of personal validation.
